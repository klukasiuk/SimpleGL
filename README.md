# SimpleGL

A simple graphics library which I created for educational purposes. I have used this library for learning people C++ programing in my science club at university.

It's still using old OpenGL 2.1 but I am planning to move to modern OpenGL.

Based on : GLFW , FTGL , SOIL2

## Usage
- Open Visual Studio solution with two projects
- First build SimpleGL project which creates static lib
- Then build SimpleGL_Example
- If everything succeds there should be lib and example exe files in build folder
- Example application is simple jumping mario animation which you can control whith arrows
- To use library link static lib to your project

## Features
- Window creation and handling
- Easy primitives rendering
- Font rendering
- Single and Double buffered rendering
- Images loading
- Mouse and Keyboard handling
- Screenshots

## Example application

Example application involves jumping mario animation. Mario can be controlled with arrows, mouse buttons rotate camera.
All code used for this example is just **200 lines**
